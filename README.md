# Sort Manager Project

## Instructions

The program will allow a user to sort a randomised array.
- The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from.
- Decision is given via the command line.
- The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line.
- The program would then output:
	- The unsorted randomly generated array
	- The sort algorithm to be used
	- The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
	- The time taken
